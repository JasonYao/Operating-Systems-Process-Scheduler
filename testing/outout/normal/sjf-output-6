The original input was: 3 ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 10 1 ) 
The (sorted) input is:  3 ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 10 1 ) 

The scheduling algorithm used was Shortest Job First

Process 0:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 9
	Turnaround time: 9
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 0

Process 1:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 10
	Turnaround time: 10
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 1

Process 2:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,10,1)
