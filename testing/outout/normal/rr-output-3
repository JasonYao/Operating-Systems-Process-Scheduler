The original input was: 3 ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 3 1 5 1 ) 
The (sorted) input is:  3 ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 3 1 5 1 ) 

The scheduling algorithm used was Round Robbin

Process 0:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 12
	Turnaround time: 12
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 3

Process 1:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 13
	Turnaround time: 13
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 4

Process 2:
	(A,B,C,M) = (3,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 16
	Turnaround time: 13
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 4

Summary Data:
	Finishing time: 16
	CPU Utilization: 0.937500
	I/O Utilization: 0.750000
	Throughput: 18.750000 processes per hundred cycles
	Average turnaround time: 12.666667
	Average waiting time: 3.666667
