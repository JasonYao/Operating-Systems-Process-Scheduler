The original input was: 3 ( 0 1 20 1 ) ( 0 1 20 1 ) ( 10 1 10 1 ) 
The (sorted) input is:  3 ( 0 1 20 1 ) ( 0 1 20 1 ) ( 10 1 10 1 ) 

The scheduling algorithm used was First Come First Served

Process 0:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,20,1)
	Finishing time: 49
	Turnaround time: 49
	I/O time: 19
	Waiting time: 10

Process 1:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,20,1)
	Finishing time: 50
	Turnaround time: 50
	I/O time: 19
	Waiting time: 11

Process 2:
