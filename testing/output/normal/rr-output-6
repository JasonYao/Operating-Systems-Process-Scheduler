The original input was: 3 ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 10 1 ) 
The (sorted) input is:  3 ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 5 1 ) ( 0 1 10 1 ) 

The scheduling algorithm used was Round Robbin

Process 0:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 13
	Turnaround time: 13
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 4

Process 1:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 14
	Turnaround time: 14
	I/O time: 4
	Waiting time: 5

Process 2:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,10,1)
	Finishing time: 25
	Turnaround time: 25
	I/O time: 9
	Waiting time: 6

Summary Data:
	Finishing time: 25
	CPU Utilization: 0.800000
	I/O Utilization: 0.680000
	Throughput: 12.000000 processes per hundred cycles
	Average turnaround time: 17.333334
	Average waiting time: 5.000000
