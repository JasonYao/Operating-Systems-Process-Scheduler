The original input was: 3 ( 1 5 30 2 ) ( 1 5 30 2 ) ( 0 5 30 2 ) 
The (sorted) input is:  3 ( 0 5 30 2 ) ( 1 5 30 2 ) ( 1 5 30 2 ) 

The scheduling algorithm used was Round Robbin

Process 0:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,5,30,2)
	Finishing time: 106
	Turnaround time: 106
	I/O time: 56
	Waiting time: 20

Process 1:
	(A,B,C,M) = (1,5,30,2)
	Finishing time: 104
	Turnaround time: 103
	I/O time: 54
	Waiting time: 19

Process 2:
	(A,B,C,M) = (1,5,30,2)
	Finishing time: 109
	Turnaround time: 108
	I/O time: 54
	Waiting time: 24
